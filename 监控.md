 为内置用户编辑创建密码
我们可以参照链接来创建我们的密码。您可以将 内置用户 用于特定的管理目的：apm_system，beats_system，elastic，kibana，logstash_system 和 remote_monitoring_user。

在使用它们之前，我们必须为它们设置密码。在 Elasticsearch 的目录里安装打入如下的命令：

./bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive
https://elasticstack.blog.csdn.net/article/details/100548174

% ../bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords interactive

Your cluster health is currently RED.
This means that some cluster data is unavailable and your cluster is not fully functional.

It is recommended that you resolve the issues with your cluster before running elasticsearch-setup-passwords.
It is very likely that the password changes will fail when run against an unhealthy cluster.

Do you want to continue with the password setup process [y/N]y

Initiating the setup of passwords for reserved users elastic,apm_system,kibana,kibana_system,logstash_system,beats_system,remote_monitoring_user.
You will be prompted to enter passwords as the process progresses.
Please confirm that you would like to continue [y/N]y
